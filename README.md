# Demo of EdDSA Double PubKey Sign Oracle misuse exploit

This program demonstrates an EdDSA Double PubKey Sign Oracle misuse exploit (aka the Chalkias EdDSA API vulnerability exploit)
which is possible when the API for an EdDSA library allows the public key to be provided as input to the sign function along with the private key.
Here we demonstrate the exploit on an old version of the cafe.cryptography.ed25519 library
version 0.1.0.

The exploit was originally discovered by Kostas Chalkias, who has written a description of the exploit and 
maintains a list of vulnerable libraries: <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/ed25519-unsafe-libs">https://github.com/MystenLabs/ed25519-unsafe-libs</a>.
